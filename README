These are my personal .dot files for bash.

You get colors, git completion, git branch naming, rails shortcuts and much more.

Some of the files are from http://github.com/slayer/dotfiles

I assume that your files are in ~/.bashrc.d.

Then symlink bash_profile and bashrc:

ln -s .bashrc.d/.bashrc .bashrc
ln -s .bashrc.d/.bash_profile .bash_profile


This is optimized for MAC OS X, but can be changed easily (for example change calls from *mate* to vim)
